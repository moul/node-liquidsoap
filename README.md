Liquidsoap node controler
=========================

This module uses [savonet/liquidsoap-controler](https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap-controler) to provide
a rich and simple API to create and manipulate liquidsoap streams in nodeJS and in the browser.

Documentation
=============

This is currently an on-going project... Documentation will be written once the API has been stabilized. 

Until then, you can checkout the [tests](https://github.com/savonet/node-liquidsoap/tree/master/test).
